# Mylar Zeppelin: "Stairway to Heaven"
### Pi in the Sky project by Max and Elijah

# Plan
## Objective
The basic goal for this project is to launch a rasberry pi into the sky in some way and take acceleration data while in flight. Also we have to make the pi make some sort of noise at he top of its trajectory.
## Description
For our project we decided to make a blimp, controlled by our pi. The frame with be made of wood and it will be covered in mylar to hold the helium inside of it. We will use bluetooth to connect an xbox controller to the pi and control the motors driving the blimp. We will also use a dual-hbridge to drive a bidirectional motor to move the blimp up and down. On top of this, we will design some sort of hanger door to drop a payload at a specified height. Finally we will make a custom PCB to drive the motors, mount the hbridge, mount the accelerometer, and house all other components to minimize clutter and reduce weight.
## Constraints
The price of helium is pretty high and the other parts can add up. The weight of the frame and the components need to be approximately equal to the up force exerted by the helium. This means figuring out the total weight before picking final dimensions for the blimp so that the heliums force is slightly greater than the total weight. Also, the range of the bluetooth connection between the pi and the controller will limit how far we can go.
