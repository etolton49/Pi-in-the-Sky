# Mylar Zeppelin: "Stairway to Heaven"
## Pi in the Sky project - Engineering 4
### by Elijah and Max

# Plan

## Objective
The basic goal for this project is to launch a rasberry pi into the sky in some way and take acceleration data while in flight. Also we have to make the pi make some sort of noise at he top of its trajectory.
## Description
For our project we decided to make a blimp, controlled by our pi. The frame with be made of wood and it will be covered in mylar to hold the helium inside of it. We will use bluetooth to connect an xbox controller to the pi and control the motors driving the blimp.
